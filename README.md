# JiffyPic - Solo Project

## *Overview* 🧐
This project is part of the **"Essential CSS Concepts"** module from the [**Frontend Career Path**](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j) course on [**Scrimba**](https://v2.scrimba.com/home).

JiffyPic simulates a social media platform where users can view posts with photos, comments, and likes. Semantic HTML, interactive CSS effects, and JavaScript were used to dynamically render the posts.

## *What I learned* 🤓

🔳 **Importing constants from JS files:** I used `import` to manage icons and data from separate files, keeping the code modular and maintainable.

🔳 **CSS filter declaration:** After exploring various methods to change icon colors (e.g. when someone 'likes' a photo) I chose the `filter` property with calculated values to achieve this effect.

🔳 **Using overlays:** I wanted to emphasize the comment modal (as well as removing interactivity from the main app while it was open). To achieve this, I created a semi-transparent overlay between the modal and the main app page.   

## **Future feature sets** 🔮

🎯 **Ability to make new posts** Would involve Google Firebase integration, a new post UI

🎯 **Ability to add comments** Let users add and like comments

🎯 **Authentication** Allow users to log in
